# 🔐 Password Cracking Challenge using John the Ripper

## 📌 Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate **password cracking techniques** using industry-standard tools such as **John the Ripper** and **Hashcat**.  
By generating password hashes (MD5/SHA1), attempting to crack them with wordlists/rules, and analyzing the results, we identify **weak passwords** and recommend stronger password policies.

⚠️ **Note**: This project is intended strictly for **educational and research purposes**. Do not use these techniques on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) – Primary password cracking tool  
- [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) – Alternative GPU-accelerated cracker  
- **Wordlists** – e.g., [rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt) or custom lists  
- **Linux/WSL tools** – `openssl`, `md5sum`, `sha1sum` for hash generation
